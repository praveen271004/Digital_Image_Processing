Requirements to start
* A Kuiper Linux image flashed to an SD card (until you finish this idt there's any way to proceed) - the analog devices website also doesnt have the flash page anymore you’ll have to gpt it
* IIO drivers enabled (pre-installed in Kuiper)
* Scope : https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope
* Scope is necessary i think to show any output
* Once the upload is done boot the OS and connect to your hardware (usb or ethernet) via terminal commands 
* Log in (default user is usually analog / analog or root / analog)


1. Type this in terminal : iio_info
2. You should see an element called ad9361_phy (only after connection of device)
3. You can read/write settings like LO frequency, sampling rate, gain, etc
4. Commands (in bash): 
cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/


# Check frequency
cat out_altvoltage0_frequency


# Set TX LO frequency to 2.4 GHz
echo 2400000000 > out_altvoltage1_frequency


# Enable TX LO
echo 1 > out_altvoltage1_powerdown
5. After this you can use python or c++ to do any kind of tasks like signal splitting or demodulation
6. Set up scope from above link
